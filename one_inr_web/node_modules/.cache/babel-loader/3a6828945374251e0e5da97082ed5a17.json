Among other features, the\r\n              Services are designed to allow a user (a \"Campaign Organizer\") to\r\n              post a fundraising campaign (\"Campaign\") to the Platform to accept\r\n              monetary donations (\"Donations\") from those users wishing to\r\n              contribute funds to the Campaign (\"Donors\"). A Campaign Organizer\r\n              may be both, a Beneficiary and a Recipient, for any Campaign.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p>\r\n              A “Beneficiary” includes an individual, a group of individuals, or\r\n              any entity that benefits from Donations through a Campaign, and a\r\n              Recipient. A “Recipient” includes an individual or entity that is\r\n              authorised by the Beneficiary through written means to receive\r\n              Donations on behalf of the Beneficiary.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p>\r\n              Charitable Giving: Campaigns, unless otherwise clearly stated by\r\n              1INR, are not charities to which you can make tax-deductible\r\n              charitable contributions. However, in addition to the Services\r\n              described above, 1INR permits Donors to contribute to certain\r\n              charitable organizations (\"Charities\") through the Platform. You\r\n              understand and acknowledge that 1INR is not a charity, and 1INR\r\n              does not solicit charitable donations for itself or for any\r\n              third-party charitable institution. You, as a Campaign Organizer,\r\n              represent and warrant that, you are not a charity as defined in\r\n              Section 80G of the Income Tax Act 1961, as amended (the \"Code\").\r\n              If you or your charity would like to register to be listed as a\r\n              charitable organization on the Platform, you can do so at the time\r\n              of setting up a Campaign. As used in this Agreement, the term\r\n              \"Campaign\" does not refer to a Charity, and you acknowledge that\r\n              contributions to Campaigns are not deductible for Indian Income\r\n              Tax deduction, unless your registered charity is authorized to\r\n              issue tax-exempt certificates under Section 80G.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p>\r\n              The Services are a Platform; We are not a Broker, Financial\r\n              Institution, Creditor or Charitable Institution: The Services are\r\n              an administrative platform only. 1INR facilitates the Donation\r\n              transaction between Campaign Organizers and Donors, but is not a\r\n              party to any agreement between a Campaign Organizer and a Donor,\r\n              or between any user and a Charity. 1INR is not a broker, agent,\r\n              financial institution, creditor or insurer for any user. 1INR has\r\n              no control over the conduct of, or any information provided by a\r\n              Campaign Organizer or a Charity, and 1INR hereby disclaims all\r\n              liability in this regard.

We do not\r\n              personally endorse any Campaign, Campaign Organizer, or Charity,\r\n              and we make no guarantee, explicit or implied, that any\r\n              information provided through the Services by a user is accurate.\r\n              We expressly disclaim any liability or responsibility for the\r\n              success of any Campaign, or the outcome of any fundraising\r\n              purpose. You, as a Donor, must make the final determination as to\r\n              the value and appropriateness of contributing to any Campaign,\r\n              Campaign Organizer, or Charity. You can write to us for any\r\n              clarification, and we shall make our best effort to share the\r\n              information that we have.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p>\r\n              While we try our best to do so, we cannot and do not verify 100%\r\n              of the information that Campaign Organizers supply. We try our\r\n              best to see that Donations are used in accordance with the stated\r\n              fundraising purpose; we also collect documents related to\r\n              Campaigns before disbursing Donations to the Campaign Organizer\r\n              for Campaigns that raise more than INR 50,000, or in other cases\r\n              that 1INR may determine, at its sole discretion. However, please\r\n              understand that we can not guarantee that 100% of the time\r\n              Donations will be used in accordance with any fundraising purpose\r\n              prescribed by a Campaign Organizer or Charity. We assume no\r\n              responsibility to verify whether the Donations are used in\r\n              accordance with any applicable laws, and such responsibility rests\r\n              solely with the Campaign Organizer or Charity, as applicable.\r\n              While we have no legal obligation to verify that the use of any\r\n              funds raised is in accordance with applicable law and these Terms\r\n              of Service, we try to do the verifications for many campaigns and\r\n              more important we take possible fraudulent activity and the misuse\r\n              of funds raised very seriously. If you have reason to believe that\r\n              a Campaign Organizer or Charity is not raising or using the funds\r\n              for their stated purpose, do write to us stating the reason for\r\n              the same, and we shall take strict action if the stated reasons\r\n              are found to be true.

In some cases, where the Campaign\r\n              Organizer has requested, through a written consent, for additional\r\n              outreach from 1INR through social media to raise funds, 1INR shall\r\n              retain an additional percentage of each Donation contributed to a\r\n              Campaign from the start of outreach effort towards the costs\r\n              incurred for such efforts (collectively, “Additional Outreach\r\n              costs”) Donors acknowledge that by contributing a Donation to a\r\n              Campaign, the Donor is agreeing to any and all applicable terms\r\n              and conditions set forth by a third party payment processor, in\r\n              addition to these Terms of Service.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p>\r\n              Fees are deducted directly from each Donation, and will not be\r\n              reflected in the amount which a Campaign Organizer can withdraw\r\n              from the Campaign or which is directed to a Charity. We reserve\r\n              the right to change 1INR's pricing from time to time. If 1INR does\r\n              change its Fees, 1INR will provide notice of the change on the\r\n              Site or in email to you, at 1INR's option, at least 30 days before\r\n              the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Services\r\n              after the Fee change becomes effective constitutes your acceptance\r\n              of the updated Fees.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p>\r\n              Account Holds: From time to time, 1INR may place a hold on a\r\n              Campaign account (a \"Hold\") restricting Withdrawals (defined\r\n              herein) by a Campaign Organizer. Some of the reasons that we may\r\n              place a Hold on a Campaign Account include the following: (i) if\r\n              we have reason to believe (in our sole discretion) that the\r\n              information provided by a Campaign Organizer is false, misleading,\r\n              or fraudulent, or that funds are being used in a prohibited\r\n              manner, (ii) if the funds available should be provided directly to\r\n              a person other than the Beneficiary (such as a legal beneficiary\r\n              or person entitled by law to act on behalf of a Beneficiary),\r\n              (iii) if we have reason to believe that a Campaign or Campaign\r\n              Organizer has violated these Terms of Service, (iv) if we think we\r\n              need additional documentation to have reasonable assurance on\r\n              utilization of Donations for the purpose stated in the Campaign,\r\n              or (iv) if required in order to comply with a court order,\r\n              subpoena, writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under\r\n              applicable laws and regulations.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p>\r\n              Withdrawing Donations from a Campaign: Subject to approvals from\r\n              1INR, you, as a Campaign Organizer (or, as applicable, the\r\n              beneficiary designated by the Campaign), may withdraw Donations to\r\n              your Campaign at any time up to the full amount of all Donations\r\n              credited to your Campaign, less Fees and any previously withdrawn\r\n              amounts (\"Withdrawals\") and subject to any Holds that we may place\r\n              on your Campaign account.{\" \"}\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n\r\n            <h4>Refund Policy</h4>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <p>\r\n              Donations made through 1INR are final and cannot be refunded,\r\n              except in accordance with 1INR’s Refund Policy.
