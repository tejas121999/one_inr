            <h4>Let Me tell you a Story!!!</h4>
            <br />

            <p>
              Raju was a poor little boy born in Jharkhand who did not go to
              school. He long wanted to learn and do some things needful for the
              society. However he was very poor to do this since he could not
              even afford a one-time meal. His parents were working hard to feed
              him and his little sister. To financially support his family Raju
              was doing odd jobs in his village. He wanted to support his father
              and mother and help make ends meet. In his endeavour to to have a
              decent meal everyday, one day he met Ramesh.{" "}
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Ramesh was a well to do guy who wanted to see everybody smile and
              be happy around. One day he met Raju, At first sight Ramesh
              understood what Raju was going through and thought of helping him.
              He told Raju about a campaign that he was running with a local NGO
              that would help him go to school and get the desired education
              that he always wanted. “Don’t worry, God and all of us are with
              you. Tomorrow you shall go to school” were the words Ramesh told
              Raju.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Hearing this he heaved a sigh of relief and looked upon his
              ambition to become a Teacher in his village and teach the poor
              students of his community. With support garnered from his
              community and the local NGO, He started going to school! Ramesh
              had indeed enrolled him for getting the basic primary education.
