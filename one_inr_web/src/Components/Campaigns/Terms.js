            <h4>Access and Use of the Service:</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              Services Description: The Services are offered as a platform (the
              "Platform") to users of the Services, which may include Campaign
              Organizers, Beneficiaries, Recipients and Donors (each defined
              herein) and other users of the Services (which may include users
              who interact with the Site or Services). Among other features, the
              Services are designed to allow a user (a "Campaign Organizer") to
              post a fundraising campaign ("Campaign") to the Platform to accept
              monetary donations ("Donations") from those users wishing to
              contribute funds to the Campaign ("Donors"). A Campaign Organizer
              may be both, a Beneficiary and a Recipient, for any Campaign.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              A “Beneficiary” includes an individual, a group of individuals, or
              any entity that benefits from Donations through a Campaign, and a
              Recipient. A “Recipient” includes an individual or entity that is
              authorised by the Beneficiary through written means to receive
              Donations on behalf of the Beneficiary.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Charitable Giving: Campaigns, unless otherwise clearly stated by
              1INR, are not charities to which you can make tax-deductible
              charitable contributions. However, in addition to the Services
              described above, 1INR permits Donors to contribute to certain
              charitable organizations ("Charities") through the Platform. You
              understand and acknowledge that 1INR is not a charity, and 1INR
              does not solicit charitable donations for itself or for any
              third-party charitable institution. You, as a Campaign Organizer,
              represent and warrant that, you are not a charity as defined in
              Section 80G of the Income Tax Act 1961, as amended (the "Code").
              If you or your charity would like to register to be listed as a
              charitable organization on the Platform, you can do so at the time
              of setting up a Campaign. As used in this Agreement, the term
              "Campaign" does not refer to a Charity, and you acknowledge that
              contributions to Campaigns are not deductible for Indian Income
              Tax deduction, unless your registered charity is authorized to
              issue tax-exempt certificates under Section 80G.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Services are a Platform; We are not a Broker, Financial
              Institution, Creditor or Charitable Institution: The Services are
              an administrative platform only. 1INR facilitates the Donation
              transaction between Campaign Organizers and Donors, but is not a
              party to any agreement between a Campaign Organizer and a Donor,
              or between any user and a Charity. 1INR is not a broker, agent,
              financial institution, creditor or insurer for any user. 1INR has
              no control over the conduct of, or any information provided by a
              Campaign Organizer or a Charity, and 1INR hereby disclaims all
              liability in this regard. Anyone is free to report issues related
              to a Campaign on 1INR, and 1INR will take necessary action to the
              best of its abilities.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              1INR does not guarantee that a Campaign or a Charity will obtain a
              certain amount of Donations or any Donations at all. We do not
              personally endorse any Campaign, Campaign Organizer, or Charity,
              and we make no guarantee, explicit or implied, that any
              information provided through the Services by a user is accurate.
              We expressly disclaim any liability or responsibility for the
              success of any Campaign, or the outcome of any fundraising
              purpose. You, as a Donor, must make the final determination as to
              the value and appropriateness of contributing to any Campaign,
              Campaign Organizer, or Charity. You can write to us for any
              clarification, and we shall make our best effort to share the
              information that we have.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              While we try our best to do so, we cannot and do not verify 100%
              of the information that Campaign Organizers supply. We try our
              best to see that Donations are used in accordance with the stated
              fundraising purpose; we also collect documents related to
              Campaigns before disbursing Donations to the Campaign Organizer
              for Campaigns that raise more than INR 50,000, or in other cases
              that 1INR may determine, at its sole discretion. However, please
              understand that we can not guarantee that 100% of the time
              Donations will be used in accordance with any fundraising purpose
              prescribed by a Campaign Organizer or Charity. We assume no
              responsibility to verify whether the Donations are used in
              accordance with any applicable laws, and such responsibility rests
              solely with the Campaign Organizer or Charity, as applicable.
              While we have no legal obligation to verify that the use of any
              funds raised is in accordance with applicable law and these Terms
              of Service, we try to do the verifications for many campaigns and
              more important we take possible fraudulent activity and the misuse
              of funds raised very seriously. If you have reason to believe that
              a Campaign Organizer or Charity is not raising or using the funds
              for their stated purpose, do write to us stating the reason for
              the same, and we shall take strict action if the stated reasons
              are found to be true. We encourage you, particularly if you intend
              to donate to a 1INR campaign or raise funds for a need, to review
              the Frequently Asked Questions section of the website to
              understand the steps taken by 1INR to foster greater trust and
              transparency.

                behalf of the platform which has hosted the project profile in
                the internet, and has facilitated the contributions to the
                project. You understand that the fees are towards web hosting,

            <p>
              Fees: 1INR does not charge a Campaign Organizer any upfront fees
              for initiating a Campaign. 1INR retains a flat percentage of each
              Donation contributed to a Campaign and all charitable
              contributions made to a Charity (collectively, "1INR Platform
              Fees"). An additional payment processing fee is also deducted from
              each Donation and is payable directly to our third party payment
              processors (the "Payment Processing Fee," and together with the
              1INR Fees, the "Fees"). In some cases, where the Campaign
              Organizer has requested, through a written consent, for additional
              outreach from 1INR through social media to raise funds, 1INR shall
              retain an additional percentage of each Donation contributed to a
              Campaign from the start of outreach effort towards the costs
              incurred for such efforts (collectively, “Additional Outreach
              costs”) Donors acknowledge that by contributing a Donation to a
              Campaign, the Donor is agreeing to any and all applicable terms
              and conditions set forth by a third party payment processor, in
              addition to these Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Fees are deducted directly from each Donation, and will not be
              reflected in the amount which a Campaign Organizer can withdraw
              from the Campaign or which is directed to a Charity. We reserve
              the right to change 1INR's pricing from time to time. If 1INR does
              change its Fees, 1INR will provide notice of the change on the
              Site or in email to you, at 1INR's option, at least 30 days before
              the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Services
              after the Fee change becomes effective constitutes your acceptance
              of the updated Fees.

              Account Holds: From time to time, 1INR may place a hold on a
              Campaign account (a "Hold") restricting Withdrawals (defined
              herein) by a Campaign Organizer. Some of the reasons that we may
              place a Hold on a Campaign Account include the following: (i) if
              we have reason to believe (in our sole discretion) that the
              information provided by a Campaign Organizer is false, misleading,
              or fraudulent, or that funds are being used in a prohibited
              manner, (ii) if the funds available should be provided directly to
              a person other than the Beneficiary (such as a legal beneficiary
              or person entitled by law to act on behalf of a Beneficiary),
              (iii) if we have reason to believe that a Campaign or Campaign
              Organizer has violated these Terms of Service, (iv) if we think we
              need additional documentation to have reasonable assurance on
              utilization of Donations for the purpose stated in the Campaign,
              or (iv) if required in order to comply with a court order,
              subpoena, writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under
              applicable laws and regulations.

              Withdrawing Donations from a Campaign: Subject to approvals from

              beneficiary designated by the Campaign), may withdraw Donations to
              your Campaign at any time up to the full amount of all Donations
              credited to your Campaign, less Fees and any previously withdrawn
              amounts ("Withdrawals") and subject to any Holds that we may place
              on your Campaign account.{" "}

                terms of service and no funds have yet been transferred to the
                Recipient towards the same. 1INR has decided to refund all the
                donations to the donors
              </li>
              <li>
                A Donation has been identified to have been initiated using an
                unauthorised payment instrument not belonging to the user by the
                user(Donor) and the user wishes a refund.
              </li>
              <li>
                Campaign organizer has posted an update that the intended
                purpose of the fundraising campaign is no longer possible and no
                funds have yet been transferred to the Recipient towards the
                same.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Any other claims for refunds shall be honoured at the discretion
              of 1INR Team.

            <br />
            <p>
              All refunds will be credited to the original mode of payment in
              7-10 bank working days.
