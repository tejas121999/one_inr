              User information on this site is kept strictly confidential. The

              We collect personal information when you make a donation. Some of
              this information is a legal requirement of the Government of
              India, such as your postal address. Other information is used to
              facilitate your use of the site such as knowing your taxpayer
              status so that we show you options that you are eligible to make
              as well as amounts in your local currency.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not collect or have access to the credit card numbers or
              bank account information our third-party vendors ( i.e. Stripe or
              Razorpay ) collect to process online transactions.

            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              1INR shall endeavour to put up only such information on the site,
              as it has verified from the NGOs, or otherwise as being true to
              the best of their knowledge and belief. However, 1INR does not
              accept any liability due to inaccuracy of information or data
              provided on this site. Any liabilities arising out of any act or
              omission by a visitor to this site, by relying on or using the
              information provided on this site, shall be solely to the account
              of such visitor.
            </p>
            <p>
              1INR will strive to ensure that the NGOs send tax exemption
              certificates and feedback reports to the donors within reasonable
              time limits. 1INR shall exert reasonable influence at its command,
              including withdrawal of non-compliant NGOs from the site, if, in
              its opinion, the situation merits such action. However, 1INR is
              indemnified by donors on this site, from any liabilities arising
              out of any kind of non-compliance by the NGOs.
            </p>
            <p>
              1INR disclaims any liability, legal or otherwise, that may arise
              due to the act, omission or otherwise of any visitor to this site,
              or caused by the same. Visitors to the site acknowledge that 1INR
              is purely a "facilitator" for transactions between the NGOs and
              visitors, and as such, stands indemnified from any liabilities
              that may arise due to the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              Visitors also acknowledge that visiting this site is an implicit
              acceptance of this disclaimer on their part.
